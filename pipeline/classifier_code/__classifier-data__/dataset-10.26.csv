Geneticists are detectives looking for dues in the mystery of inheritance.,1
"Once Mendel's work was rediscovered in the 1900s, scientists began to search for the molecule involved in inheritance.",0
"Scientists knew that genetic information was carried on the chromosomes in eukaryotic cells, and that the two main components of chromosomes are DNA and protein.",0
"For many years, scientists tried to determine which of these macromolecules—nucleic acid(DNA)or proteins—was the source of genetic information.",0
Griffith The first major experiment that led to the discovery of DNA as the genetic material was performed by Fredrick Griffith in 1928.,0
"Griffith studied two strains of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia.",0
"He found that one strain could be transformed, or changed, into the other form.",0
"Of the two strains he studied, one had a sugar coat and one did not.",0
Both strains are shown in Figure 12.1.,0
The coated strain causes pneumonia and is called the smooth(S)strain.,0
"The noncoated strain does not cause pneumonia and is called the rough (R) strain because, without the coat, the bacteria colonies have rough edges.",0
Follow Griffith's study described in Figure 12.2.,0
Notice the live S cells killed the mouse in the study.,0
"The live R cells did not kill the mouse, and the killed S cells did not kill the mouse.",0
"However, when Griffith made a mixture of live R cells and killed S cells and injected the mixture into a mouse, the mouse died.",0
Griffith isolated live bacteria from the dead mouse.,0
"When these isolated bacteria were cultured, the smooth trait was visible, suggesting that a disease-causing factor was passed from the killed S bacteria to the live R bacteria.",0
Griffith concluded that there had been a transformation from live R bacteria to live S bacteria.,0
This experiment set the stage for the search to identify the transforming substance.,0
"Avery In 1944,Oswald Avery and his colleagues identified the molecule that transformed the R strain of bacteria into the S strain.",0
"Avery isolated different macromolecules, such as DNA, protein, and lipids, from killed S cells.",0
Then he exposed live R cells to the macromolecules separately.,0
"When the live R cells were exposed to the S strain DNA, they were transformed into S cells.",0
"Avery concluded that when the S cells in Griffith's experiments were killed, DNA was released.",0
"Some of the R bacteria incorporated this DNA into their cells, and this changed the bacteria into S cells.",0
"Avery's conclusions were not widely accepted by the scientific community,and many biologists continued to question and experiment to determine whether proteins or DNA were responsible for the transfer of genetic material.",0
Reading Check Explain how Avery discovered the transforming factor.,0
"In 1952,Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase published results of experiments that provided definitive evidence that DNA is the transforming factor.",0
"These experiments involved a bacteriophage(bak TIHR ee uh fayj),a type of virus that attacks bacteria.",0
Two components made the experiment ideal for confirming that DNA is the genetic material.,0
"First, the bacteriophage used in the experiment was made of DNA and protein.",0
"Second, viruses cannot replicate themselves.",0
They must inject their genetic material into a living cell to reproduce.,0
"Hershey and Chase labeled both parts of the virus to determine which part was injected into the bacteria and, thus, which part was the genetic material.",0
Figure 12.2 Griffith's transformation experiment demonstrates the change of rough bacteria into smooth bacteria.,1
Explain why Griffith concluded there had been a change from live R bacteria to live S bacteria.,1
Transform: to cause a change in type or kind.,1
Avery used DNA to transform bacteria.,1

E.coli and viruses are placed together into liquid culture medium.,1
"Viruses infect the bacteria, injecting their genetic material.",1
The mixture is agitated to dislodge the viruses from the bacteria.,1
Most 32p is in the bacterial cells.,1
Most 35S is in the liquid with the viral proteins.,1
Figure 12.3 Hershey and Chase used radioactive labeling techniques to demonstrate that DNA is the genetic material in Viruses.,0
Radioactive labeling Hershey and Chase used a technique called radioactive labeling to trace the fate of the DNA and protein as the bacteriophages infected bacteria and reproduced.,0
Follow along in Figure 12.3 as you continue learning about the Hershey-Chase experiment.,0
They labeled one set of bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus(32P).,0
"Proteins do not contain phosphorous, so DNA and not protein in these viruses would be radioactive.",0
Hershey and Chase labeled another set of bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur(35S).,0
"Because proteins contain sulfur and DNA does not, proteins and not DNA would be radioactive.",0
Hershey and Chase infected bacteria with viruses from the two groups.,0
"When viruses infect bacteria, they attach to the outside of the bacteria and inject their genetic material.",0
The infected bacteria then were separated from the viruses.,0
Tracking DNA Hershey and Chase examined Group l labeled with 32P and found that the labeled viral DNA had been injected into the bacteria.,0
"Viruses later released from the infected bacteria contained 32P,further indicating that DNA was the carrier ofgenetic information.",0
"When examining Group 2 labeled with 35S, Hershey and Chase observed that the labeled proteins were found outside of the bacterial cells.",0
"Viral replication had occurred in the bacterial cells, indicating that the viruses'genetic material had entered the bacteria, but no label(35S)was found.",0
Table 12.1 summarizes the results of the Hershey-Chase experiment.,0
"Based on their results, Hershey and Chase concluded that the viral DNA was injected into the cell and provided the genetic information needed to produce new viruses.",1
"This experiment provided powerful evidence that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material that could be passed from generation to generation in viruses.",1
"After the Hershey-Chase experiment, scientists were more confident that DNA was the genetic material.",1
"The clues had led to the identification of the genetic material, but the questions of how nucleotides came together to form DNA and how DNA could communicate information remained.",0
"Nucleotides In the 1920s, the biochemist P.A.",0
Levene determined the basic structure of nucleotides that make up DNA.,0
"Nucleotides are the subunits of nucleic acids and consist of a five-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.",1
"The two nucleic acids found in living cells are DNA and RNA, which you learned about in Chapter 6.",1
"DNA nucleotides contain the sugar deoxyribose (dee ahk sih RI bos), a phosphate, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine(A duh neen), guanine(GWAH neen), cytosine(SI tuh seen), or thymine(THI meen).",1
"RNA nucleotides contain the sugar ribose, a phosphate, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil (YOO ruh sihl).",1
Notice in Figure 12.4 that guanine(G)and adenine(A) are double-ringed bases.,1
This type of base is called a purine base.,1
"Thymine(T), cytosine(C),and uracil (U) are single-ringed bases called pyrimidine bases.",1
"Chargaff Erwin Chargaff analyzed the amount of adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine in the DNA of various species.",0
"A portion of Chargaff's data, published in 1950, is shown in Figure 12.5.",0
"Chargaff found that the amount of guanine nearly equals the amount of cytosine, and the amount of adenine nearly equals the amount of thymine within a species.",1
This finding is known as Chargaff'srule:C=GandT=A.,1
"The structure question When fourscientists joined the search for the DNA structure, the meaning and importance of Chargaffs data became clear.",0
"Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist; Maurice Wilkins, a British physicist; Francis Crick, a British physicist; and James Watson, an American biologist, provided information that was pivotal in answering the DNA structure question.",0
Figure 12.4 Nucleotides are made of a phosphate sugar and a base.,1
There are five different bases found in nucleotide subunits that make up DNA and RNA.,1
Identify What is the structural difference between purine pyrimidine,0
"Figure 12.5 Chargaff's data showed that though base composition varies from species to species, within a species C=G andA=T",1
Figure 12.6 Rosalind Franklin's Photo 51 and X-ray diffraction data helped Watson and Crick solve the structure of DNA.,0
"When analyzed and measured carefully, the pattern shows the characteristics of helix structure.",0
"Figure 12.7 Using Chargaffs and Franklin's data, Watson and Crick solved the puzzle of the structure of DNA.",0
"X-ray diffraction Wilkins was working at King's College in London, England, with a technique called X-ray diffraction, a technique that involved aimingX rays at the DNA molecule.",1
"In 1951, Franklin joined the staff at King's College.",0
There she took the now famous Photo 5l and collected data eventually used by Watson and Crick.,0
"Photo 51, shown in Figure 12.6, indicated that DNA was a double helix, or twisted ladder shape, formed by two strands of nucleotides twisted around each other.",1
The specific structure of the DNA double helix was determined later by Watson and Crick when they used Franklin's data and other mathematical data.,0
"DNA is the genetic material ofall organisms, composed of two complementary, precisely paired strands of nucleotides wound in a double helix.",1
"Watson and Crick Watson and Crick were working at Cambridge University in Cambridge, England, when they saw Franklin's X-ray diffraction picture.",0
"Using Chargaff's data and Franklin's data, Watson and Crick measured the width of the helix and the spacing of the bases.",0
"Together, they built a model of the double helix that conformed to the others'research.",0
The model they built is shown in Figure 12.7.,0
Some important features of their proposed molecule include the following:,0
1. two outside strands consist of alternating deoxyribose and phosphate,1
2. cytosine and guanine bases pair to each other by three hydrogen bonds,1
3. thymine and adenine bases pair to each other by two hydrogen bonds,1
"DNA structure DNA often is compared to a twisted ladder, with the rails of the ladder represented by the alternating deoxyribose and phosphate.",1
"The pairs of bases(cytosine-guanine or thymine-adenine) form the steps, or rungs, of the ladder.",1
"A purine base always binds to a pyrimidine base, ensuring a consistent distance between the two rails of the ladder.",1
"This proposed bonding of the bases also explains Chargaff's data, which suggested that the number of purine bases equaled the number of pyrimidine bases in a sample of DNA.",1
"Remember, cytosine and thymine are pyrimidine bases, adenine and guanine are purines, and C=Gand A=T.",1
"Therefore,C+T=G+A,or purine bases equal pyrimidine bases.",1
Complementary base pairing is used to describe the precise pairing of purine and pyrimidine bases between strands of nucleic acids.,1
It is the characteristic of DNA replication through which the parent strand can determine the sequence ofa new strand.,1
Reading Check,0
Explain why Chargaff's data was an important clue for putting together the structure of DNA.,1
"Orientation Another unique feature of the DNA molecule is the direction, or orientation, of the two strands.",1
Carbon molecules can be numbered in organic molecules.,1
Figure 12.8 shows the orientation of the numbered carbons in the sugar molecules on each strand of DNA.,1
"On the top rail, the orientation of the sugar has the 5'(read“five-prime”) carbon on the left, and on the end ofthat rail, the 3'(read“three-prime”) carbon is on the right of the sugar-phosphate chain.",1
The strand is said to be oriented 5'to 3.,1
The strand on the bottom runs in the opposite direction and is oriented 3'to 5.,1
This orientation of the two strands is called antiparallel.,1
Another way to visualize antiparallel orientation is to take two pencils and position them so that the point of one pencil is next to the eraser of the other and vice versa.,1
"The announcement In 1953,Watson and Crick surprised the scientific community by publishing a one-page letter in the journal Nature that suggested a structure for DNA and hypothesized a method of replication for the molecule deduced from the structure.",0
"In articles individually published in the same issue, Wilkins and Franklin presented evidence that supported the structure proposed by Watson and Crick.",0
"Still, the mysteries of how to prove DNA's replication and how it worked as a genetic code remained.",0
Figure 12.8 Two strands of DNA running antiparallel make up the DNA helix.,1

1.Describe the structure of your DNA molecule.,0
2. Identify the characteristics of DNA that you focused on when constructing your model.,0
In what way is your model different from your classmates' models?,0
How does this relate to differences in DNA among organisms?,0
"In prokaryotes, the DNA molecule is contained in the cytoplasm and consists mainly of a ring of DNA and associated proteins.",1
Eukaryotic DNA is organized into individual chromosomes.,1
The length of a human chromosome ranges from 5l million to 245 million base pairs.,1
"Ifa DNA strand 140 million nucleotides long was laid out in a straight line, it would be about five centimeters long.",1
How does all of this DNA fit into a microscopic cell?,0
"In order to fit into the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, the DNA tightly coils around a group of beadlike proteins called histones, as shown in Figure 12.9.",1
"The phosphate groups in DNA create a negative charge, which attracts the DNA to the positively charged histone proteins and forms a nucleosome.",1
"The nucleosomes then group together into chromatin fibers, which supercoil to make up the DNA structure recognized as a chromosome.",1
Griffith's bacterial experiment and Avery's explanation first indicated that DNA is the genetic material.,1
The Hershey-Chase experiment provided evidence that DNA is the genetic material of viruses.,1
"Chargaffs rule states that, in DNA, the amount of gtosine equals the amount of guanine and the amount of thymine equals the amount of adenine.",1
"The work of Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins provided evidence of the double-helix structure of DNA.",1

Students know how to apply base-pairing rules to explain precise copying of DNA during semiconservative replication and transcription of information from DNA into mRNA.,0
Summarize the role of the enzymes involved in the replication of DNA.,0
Explain how leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently.,0
template: a molecule of DNA that is a pattern for synthesis of a new DNA molecule,1
"In semiconservative replication, the parental DNA separates and serves as templates to produce two daughter DNA, which then can separate to produce four DNA.",1
DNA replicates by making a strand that is complementary to each original strand.,1
"When copies are made using a photocopy machine, they are expected to be exact copies of the original.",1
Making a copy would not be very efficient if it contained errors that were not in the original.,1
Think about how your body might make copies of DNA.,0
"When Watson and Crick presented their model of DNA to the science community, they also suggested a possible method of replication— semiconservative replication.",1
"During semiconservative replication, parental strands of DNA separate, serve as templates, and produce DNA molecules that have one strand of parental DNA and one strand of new DNA.",1
Recall from Chapters9 and 10 that DNA replication occurs during interphase of mitosis and meiosis.,1
An overview of semiconservative replication is in Figure 12.10.,0
"The process of semiconservative replication occurs in three main stages: unwinding, base pairing, and joining.",1
"Unwinding DNA helicase,an enzyme, is responsible for unwinding and unzipping the double helix.",1
"When the double helix is unzipped, the hydrogen bonds between the bases are broken, leaving single strands of DNA.",1
"Then, proteins called single-stranded binding proteins associate with the DNA to keep the strands separate during replication.",1
"As the helix unwinds, another enzyme, RNA primase, adds a short segment of RNA, called an RNA primer, on each DNA strand.",1
How does the DNA molecule replicate?,0
Use a model to better understand the replication of the DNA molecule.,0
1. Read and complete the lab safety form.,0

1.Explain how your model of DNA replication shows semiconservative replication.,0
2.Infer How would DNA replication in a cell be affected by an absence of DNA ligase?,0
3. Identify Where in the replication process could errors occur?,0
Base pairing The enzyme DNA polymerase catalyzes the addition of appropriate nucleotides to the new DNA strand.,1
"The nucleotides are added to the 3'end of the new strand, as illustrated in Figure 12.11.DNA polymerase continues adding new DNA nucleotides to the chain by adding to the 3'end of the new DNA strand.",1
Recall that each base binds only to its complement—A binds to T and Cbinds to G.,1
"In this way, the templates allow identical copies of the original double-stranded DNA to be produced.",1
Notice in Figure 12.11 that the two strands are made in a slightly different manner.,1
One strand is called the leading strand and is elongated as the DNA unwinds.,1
This strand is built continuously by the additio n of nucleotides to the 3'end.,1
"The other strand of DNA, called the lagging strand, elongates away from the replication fork.",1
"It is synthesiz ed discontinuously into small segments, called Okazakifragments, by the DNA polymerase in the 3'to 5' direction.",1
These fragments are later connected by the enzyme DNA ligase.,1
Each Okazaki fragment is about 100-200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes.,1
"Because one strand is synthesized continuously and the other is synthesized discontinuously, DNA replication is said to be semidiscontinuous as well as semiconservative.",1
Reading Check Explain How does base pairing during replication ensure that the strands produced are identical to the original strand?,1
"Interactive Figure To see an animation of DNA replication, visit biologygmh.com.",0
Figure 12.11 The DNA strands are separated during replication as each parent strand serves as a template for new strands.,1
Infer why the lagging strand produces fragments instead of being synthesized continuously.,1
"Joining Even though the leading strand is synthesized continuously, in eukaryotic DNA replication there often are many areas along the chromosome where replication begins.",1
"When the DNA polymerase comes to an RNA primer on the DNA, it removes the primer and fills in the place with DNA nucleotides.",1
"When the RNA primer has been replaced, DNA ligase links the two sections.",1
Comparing DNA Replication in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes,1
Eukaryotic DNA unwinds in multiple areas as DNA is replicated.,1
"Each individual area of a chromosome replicates as a section, which can vary in length from 10,000 to one million base pairs.",1
"As a result, multiple areas of replication are occurring along the large eukaryotic chromosome at the same time.",1
"Multiple replication origins look like bubbles in the DNA strand, as shown in Figure 12.12.",1
"In prokaryotes, the circular DNA strand is opened at one origin of replication, as shown in Figure 12.12.",1
"Notice in the figure that DNA replication occurs in two directions, just as it does in eukaryotes.",1
Recall from Chapter 7 that prokaryotic DNA typically is shorter than eukaryotic DNA and remains in the cytoplasm—not packaged in a nucleus.,1
Figure 12.12 Eukaryotes have many origins of replication.,1
"Bacteria have one origin of replication, with the DNA replicating in both directions when it unzips.",1
"The enzymes DNA helicase, RNA primase, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase are involved in DNA replication.",1
"The leading strand is synthesized continuously, but the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously, forming Okazaki fragments.",1
"Prokaryotic DNA opens at a single origin of replication,whereas eukaryotic DNA has multiple areas of replication.",1
"Students know the general pathway by which ribosomes synthesize proteins, using tRNAs to translate genetic information in mRNA.",0
"DNA codes for RNA,which guides protein synthesis.",1
"Computer programmers write their programs in a particular language, or code.",1
The computer is designed to read the code and perform a function.,1
"Like the programming code, DNA contains a code that signals the cell to perform a function.",1
One of the important features of DNA that remained unresolved beyond the work of Watson and Crick was how DNA served as a genetic code for the synthesis of proteins.,1
Recall from Chapter 6 that proteins function as structural building blocks for the cells and as enzymes.,1
Geneticists now accept that the basic mechanism of reading and expressing genes is from DNA to RNA to protein.,1
This chain of events occurs in all living things—from bacteria to humans.,1
"Scientists refer to this mechanism as the central dogma of biology: DNA codes for RNA, which guides the synthesis of proteins.",1
RNA is a nucleic acid that is similar to DNA.,1
"However, RNA contains the sugar ribose, the base uracil replaces thymine, and usually is single stranded.",1
Three major types of RNA are found in living cells.,1
Messenger RNA (mRNA)molecules are longstrands of RNA nucleotides that are formed complementary to one strand of DNA.,1
They travel from the nucleus to the ribosome to direct the synthesis of a specific protein.,1
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)is the type of RNA that associates with proteins to form ribosomes in the cytoplasm.,1
"The third type of RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA)are smaller segments of RNA nucleotides that transport amino acids to the ribosome.",1
Table 12.2 compares the structure and function of the three types of RNA.,0

Figure 12.13 RNA is grown in the 5'to 3'direction.,1
Identify which enzyme adds nucleotides to the growing RNA.,1
The first step of the central dogma involves the synthesis of mRNA from DNA in a process called transcription (trans KRIHP shun).,1
"Through transcription, the DNA code is transferred to mRNA in the nucleus.",1
The mRNA then can take the code into the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.,1
Follow along with the process of transcription in Figure 12.13.,0
"The DNA is unzipped in the nucleus and RNA polymerase, an enzyme that regulates RNA synthesis, binds to a specific section where an mRNA will be synthesized.",1
"As the DNA strand unwinds, the RNA polymerase initiates mRNA synthesis and moves along one of the DNA strands in the 3'to 5' direction.",1
"The strand of DNA that is read by RNA polymerase is called the template strand, and mRNA is synthesized as a complement to the DNA nucleotides.",1
The DNA strand not used as the template strand is called the nontemplate strand.,1
"The mRNA transcript is manufactured in a 5' to 3' direction, adding each new RNA nucleotide to the 3'end.",1
Uracil is incorporated instead of thymine as the mRNA molecule is made.,1
"Eventually, the mRNA is released, and the RNA polymerase detaches from the DNA.",1
The new mRNA then moves out of the nucleus through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.,1
Explain the direction in which the mRNA transcript is manufactured.,0
"RNA processing When scientists compared the coding region of the DNA with mRNA that ultimately coded for a protein , they found that the mRNA code is significantly shorter than the DNA code.",1
"Upon closer examination, they discovered that the code on the DNA is interrupted periodically by sequences that are not in the final mRNA.",1
"These sequences are called intervening sequences, or introns.",1
The coding sequences that remain in the final mRNA are called exons.,1
"In eukaryotes, the original mRNA made in the nucleus is sometimes called premRNA and contains all of the DNA code.",1
"Before the pre-mRNA leaves the nucleus, the introns are removed from it.",1
"Other processing of the pre-mRNA includes adding a protective cap on the 5'end and adding a tail of many adenine nucleotides, called the poly-A tail, to the 3'end of the mRNA.Research shows that the cap aids in ribosome recognition, though the significance of the poly-A tail remains unknown.",1
The mRNA that reaches the ribosome has been processed.,1
Incorporate information from this section into your Foldable.,0
"This ""dictionary"" of the genetic code is helpful for knowing which codons code for which amino acids.",1
Determine the possible sequences that would produce the amino acid chain:start—serine—histidine—tryptophan—stop.,1
The Code Biologists began to hypothesize that the instructions for protein synthesis are encoded in the DNA.,1
They recognized that the only way the DNA varied among organisms was in the sequence of the bases.,1
"Scientists knew that 20 amino acids were used to make proteins, so they knew that the DNA must provide at least 20 different codes.",1
Math The hypothesis for how the bases formed the code is based on math and logic.,1
"If each base coded for one amino acid, then the four bases could code for four amino acids.",1
"If each pair of bases coded for one amino acid, then the four bases could only code for 16(4×4or42) amino acids.",1
"However, if a group of three bases coded for one amino acid, there would be 64(43) possible codes.",1
"This provides more than the 20 codes needed for the 20 amino acids, but is the smallest possible combination of bases to provide enough codes for the amino acids.",1
"This reasoning meant that the code was not contained in the base pairs themselves, but must run along a single strand of the DNA.",1
Experiments during the 1960s demonstrated that the DNA code was indeed a three-base code.,1
The three-base code in DNA or mRNA is called a codon.,1
Each of the three bases of a codon in the DNA is transcribed into the mRNA code.,1
Figure 12.14 shows a “dictionary”of the genetic code.,0
Notice that all amino acid methionine and a lso functions as the start codon.,0
"Translation Once the mRNA is synthesized and processed, it moves to the ribosome.",0
"In eukaryotes, this means the mRNA must l eave the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm.",0
"Once in the cytoplasm, the 5 end of the mRNA connects to the ribosome.",0
This is where the code is read and translated to make a protein through a process called translation.,0
Follow along in Figure 12.15 as you learn about translation.,0
"In translation, tRNA molecules act as the interpreters of the mRNA codon sequence.",0
The tRNA is folded into a cloverleaf shape and is activated by an enzyme that attaches a specific amino acid to the 3'end.,0
"At the middle of the folded strand, there is a three-base coding sequence called the anticodon.",0
Each anticodon is complementary to a codon on the mRNA.,0
"Though the code in DNA and RNA is read 5'to 3',the anticodon is read 3'to 5'.",1
Transcription takes place in the nucleus.,1
Translation occurs in the cytoplasm and results in the formation of polypeptides.,1
mRNA is transfrom a DNA template by RNA polymerase.,1
mRNA nudeus and associates 5' with the ribosomal subunits.,1
An enzyme activates tRNA by attaching a specific amino acid to each tRNA.,1
tRNAs add their amino acids to the polypeptide chain as the mRNA moves through the ribosome one codon at a time.,1
"When a stop codon is reached, translation terminates and the polypeptide is released.",1
"0 Interactive Figure To see an animation of transcription and translation,visit biologygmh.col m,",0
"Draw a flowchart that connects the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.",0
"The ribosome consists of two subunits, as shown in Figure 12.15.These subunits are not associated when they are not involved in protein translation.",1
"When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the two parts of the ribosome come together and attach to the mRNA to complete the ribosome.",1
"Once the mRNA is associated with the ribosome, a tRNA with the anticodon CAU carrying a methionine will move in and bind to the mRNA start codon—AUG—on the 5'end of the mRNA.The ribosome structure has a groove, called the P site, where the tRNA that is complementary to the mRNA moves in.",1
"A second tRNA moves into a second groove in the ribosome, called the A site, and corresponds to the next codon of the mRNA.",1
"The next codon is UUU, so a tRNA with the anticodon AAA moves in, carrying the amino acid phenylalanine.",1
Part of the rRNA in the ribosome now acts as an enzyme catalyzing the formation of a bond between the new amino acid in the A site and the amino acid in the P site.,1
"As the two amino acids join, the tRNA in the P site is released to the third site, called the E site, where it exits the ribosome.",1
"The ribosome then moves so the tRNA found in Groove A is shifted to Site P,as shown in Figure 12.15.Now a new tRNA will enter the A site, complementing the next codon on the mRNA.",1
This process will continue adding and linking amino acids in the sequence determined by the mRNA.,1
The ribosome continues to move along until the A site contains a stop codon.,1
The stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis and does not complement any tRNA.,1
"Proteins called release factors cause the mRNA to be released from the last tRNA and the ribosome subunits to disassemble,ending protein synthesis.",1
How can a virus affect transcription?,1
"To study RNA synthesis, a group of scientists used a fluorescent molecular beacon to trace molecules.",1
This increases as the RNA chain lengthens.,1
"Thus, the beacon can be used to follow RNA synthesis.",1
"In this experiment, scientists added the antibiotic rifampin (rif) to RNA polymerase from a virus (T7 RNAP),Escherchia coli(E .coliRNAP), and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M .smegmatis RNAP) and followed RNA synthesis.",1
1.Describe the relationship between the fluorescence level and time in each experiment not exposed to rifampin.,0
"Once scientists learned how DNA works as a code, they needed to learn the relationships between the genes and the proteins for which they coded.",1
Experiments on the mold Neurospora were the first to demonstrate the relationship between genes and enzymes.,1
"In the 1940s, George Beadle and Edward Tatum provided evidence that a gene can code for an enzyme.",1
They studied mold spores that were mutated by exposure to X rays.,1
Examine Figure 12.16 to follow along with their experiment.,0
"Normally, Neurospora can grow on an artificial medium that provides no amino acids.",1
This type of medium is called minimal medium.,1
Complete medium provides all the amino acids that Neurospora needs to function.,1
"In Beadle and Tatum's experiment, the spores were exposed toX rays and grown on a complete medium.",1
"To test for a mutated spore, the scientists grew spores on a minimal medium.",1
"When a spore was unable to grow on the minimal medium, the mutant was tested to see what amino acid it lacked.",1
"When the mold-spore type grew on a minimal medium with a supplement such as arginine, Beadle and Tatum hypothesized that the mutant was missing the enzyme needed to synthesize arginine.",1
Beadle and Tatum came up with what is known as the“one gene—one enzyme”hypothesis.,1
"Today, because we know that polypeptides make up enzymes, their hypothesis has been modified slightly to refer to the fact that one gene codes for one polypeptide.",1
The Beadle and Tatum experiment showed that a gene codes for an enzyme.,1
We now know that a gene codes for a polypeptide.,1
"Three major types of RNA are involved in protein synthesis: mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",1
The synthesis of the mRNA from the template DNA is called transcription.,1
Translation is the process through which the mRNA attaches to the ribosome and a protein is assembled.,1
"In eukaryotes, the mRNA contains introns that are excised before leaving the nucleus.",1
A cap and poly-A tail also are added to the mRNA.,1

How do prokaryotic cells regulate which genes will be transcribed at particular times in the lifetime of an organism?,1
Gene regulation is the ability of an organism to control which genes ar e transcribed in response to the environment.,1
"In prokaryotes, an operon o ften controls the transcription ofgenes in response to changes in the environment.",1
An operon is a section of DNA that contains the genes for the proteins needed for a specific metabolic pathway.,1
"The parts of an operon include an operator, promoter, regulatory gene, and the genes coding for proteins.",1
The operator is a segment of DNA that acts as an on/offswitch for transcription.,1
"A second segment of DNA, called the promoter, is where the RNA polymerase first binds to the DNA.",1
"The bacteria Escherichia coli(E.coli) respond to tryptophan, an amino acid, and lactose, a sugar, through two operons.",1
"The trp operon In bacteria, tryptophan synthesis occurs in a series of five steps, and each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.",1
The five genes coding for these enzymes are clustered together on the bacterial chromosome with a group of DNA that controls whether or not they are transcribed.,1
This cluster of DNA is called the tryptophan (trp) operon and is illustrated in Figure 12.17.,1
"The trp operon is referred to as a repressible operon because transcription of the five enzyme genes normally is repressed, or turned off.",1
"When tryptophan is present in the cell's environment, the cell has no need to synthesize it and the trp repressor gene turns off, or represses, the transcription process by making a repressor protein.",1
"Tryptophan in E.colicombines with an inactive repressor protein to activate it, and the complex binds to the operator in the promoter sequence.",1
"If the repressor is bound to the operator, RNA polymerase cannot bind to it, which prevents the transcription of the enzyme genes.",1
This prohibits the synthesis of tryptophan by the cell.,1
"When tryptophan levels are low, the repressor is not bound to tryptophan and is inactive— it does not bind to the operator.",1
"The RNA polymerase is able to bind to the operator, turning on transcription of the five enzyme genes.",1
This transcription enables the synthesis of tryptophan by the cell.,1
Notice the location of the repressor protein in Figure 12.17 when the operon is turned both offand on.,1
Reading Check Summarize the effect of tryptophan on the trp operon.,1
"The lac operon When lactose is present in the cell, E.colimakes enzymes that enable it to use lactose as an energy source.",1
"The lactose (lac)operon, illustrated in Figure 12.18, contains a promoter, an operator, a regulatory gene, and three enzyme genes that control lac digestion.",1
"In the lac operon, the regulatory gene makes a repressor protein that binds to the operator in the promoter sequence and prevents the transcription of the enzyme genes.",1
"When a molecule called an inducer is present, the inducer binds to the repressor and inactivates it.",1
"In the lac operon, the inducer is allolactose, a molecule that is present in food that contains lactose.",1
"Thus, when lactose is present, the allolactose binds to the repressor and inactivates it.",1
"With the repressor inactivated, RNA polymerase then can bind to the promoter and begin transcription.",1
The lac operon is called an inducible operon because transcription is turned on by an inducer.,1
"Microbiologist Scientists who study microbes, primarily prokaryotes, are called microbiologists.",1
They might research to learn about which genes control the production of particular proteins or how a protein affects the life of a cell.,1

Figure 12.19 Hox genes are responsible for the general body pattern of most animals.,1
Notice that the order of the genes is the same as the order of the body sections the genes control.,1
Eukaryotic cells also must control what genes are expressed at different times in the organism's lifetime.,1
"In eukaryotic cells, many genes interact with one another, requiring more elements than a single promoter and operator for a set of genes.",1
"The organization and structure of eukaryotic cells is more complex than in prokaryotic cells, increasing the complexity of the control system.",1
Controlling transcription One way that eukaryotes control gene expression is through proteins called transcription factors.,1
Transcription factors ensure that a gene is used at the right time and that proteins are made in the right amounts.,1
There are two main sets of transcription factors.,1
One set of transcription factors forms complexes that guide and stabilize the binding of the RNA polymerase to a promoter.,1
The other set includes regulatory proteins that help control the rate of transcription.,1
"For instance, proteins called activators fold DNA so that enhancer sites are close to the complex and increase the rate of gene transcription.",1
Repressor proteins also bind to specific sites on the DNA and prevent the binding of activators.,1
The complex structure of eukaryotic DNA also regulates transcription.,1
Recall that eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histones to form nucleosomes.,1
"This structure provides some inhibition of transcription, although regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase still can activate specific genes even when they are packaged in the nucleosome.",1
Hox genes Gene regulation is crucial during development.,1
Recall that multicellular eukaryotes develop from a single cell called a zygote.,1
"The zygote undergoes mitosis, producing all the different kinds of cells needed by the organism.",1
Differentiation is the process through which the cells become specialized in structure and function.,1
One group of genes that controls differentiation has been discovered.,1
These genes are called homeobox(Hox) genes.,1
Hox genes are important for determining the body plan of an organism.,1
They code for transcription factors and are active in zones of the embryo that are in the same order as the genes on the chromosome.,1
"For example, the colored regions of the fly and fly embryo in Figure 12.19 correspond to the colored genes on the piece of DNA in the figure.",1
"These genes, transcribed at specific times, and located in specific places on the genome, control what body part will develop in a given location.",1
One mutation in the Hox genes of fruit flies has yielded flies with legs growing where their antennae should be.,1
Studying these flies has helped scientists understand more about how genes control the body plan ofan organism.,1
Similar clusters of Hox genes that control body plans have been found in all animals.,1
RNA interference Another method of eukaryotic gene regulation is RNA interference(RNAi).,1
Small pieces of double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm of the cell are cut by an enzyme called dicer.,1
The resulting double-stranded segments are called small interfering RNA.,1
They bind to a protein complex that degrades one strand of the RNA.,1
"The resulting single-stranded small interfering RNA and protein complex bind to sequence-specific sections of mRNA in the cytoplasm, causing the mRNA in this region to be cut and thus preventing its translation.",1
Figure 12.20 shows the single-stranded small interfering RNA and protein complex binding to the mRNA.,1
"Research and clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the possibility of using RNAi to treat cancer, diabetes, and other diseases.",1

Do you ever make mistakes when you are typing an assignment?,0
"When you type, sometimes you might strike the wrong key.",1
"Just as you might make a mistake when typing, cells sometimes make mistakes during replication.",1
"However, these mistakes are rare, and the cell has repair mechanisms that can repair some damage.",1
Sometimes a permanent change occurs in a cell's DNA and this is called a mutation.,1
Recall that one inheritance pattern that Mendel studied was round and wrinkled pea seeds.,1
It is now known that the wrinkled phenotype is associated with the absence of an enzyme that influences the shape of starch molecules in the seeds.,1
"Because the mutation in the gene causes a change in the protein that is made, the enzyme is nonfunctional.",1
Types of mutations Mutations can range from changes in a single base pair in the coding sequence of DNA to the deletions of large pieces of chromosomes.,1
Point mutations involve a chemical change in just one base pair and can be enough to cause a genetic disorder.,1
A point mutation in which one base is exchanged for another is called a substitution.,1
"Most substitutions are missense mutations, where the DNA code is altered so that it codes for the wrong amino acid.",1
"Other substitutions, called nonsense mutations, change the codon for an amino acid to a stop codon.",1
Nonsense mutations cause translation to terminate early.,1
Nearly all nonsense mutations lead to proteins that cannot function normally.,1
Figure 12.20 RNA interference can stop the mRNA from translating its message.,1
Describe how the RNA-protein complex prevents the translation of the mRNA.,1
Substitution: The act of replacing one thing with another.,1
The substitution of adenine for guanine in the DNA caused a dysfunctional protein.,1
Another type of mutation that can occur involves the gain or loss of a nucleotide in the DNA sequence.,1
"Insertions are additions of a nucleotide to the DNA sequence, and the loss of a nucleotide is called a deletion.",1
"Both of these mutations change the multiples of three codons, from the point of the insertion or deletion, and they are called frameshift mutations because they change the“frame”of the amino acid sequence.",1
Table 12.3 illustrates various types of mutations and their effect on the DNA sequence.,1
Sometimes mutations are associated with diseases and disorders.,1
"One example is Garrod's alkaptonuria, which was described in Chapter 11.",1
Patients with this disorder have a mutation in their DNA coding for an enzyme involved in digesting the amino acid phenylalanine.,1
This mutation results in the black-colored homogentistic acid that discolors the urine.,1
Studies have shown that patients with alkaptonuria have a high occurrence of frameshift and missense mutations in a specific region of their DNA.,1
Table 12.3 lists some more examples of diseases associated with types of mutation.,0

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 1A): damage to peripheral nerves leading to weakness and atrophy of muscles in hands and lower legs,1
"RAT Huntington's disease: a progressive disease in which brain cells waste away, producing uncontrolled movements, emotional disturbances, and mental deterioration",1
Large portions of DNA also can be involved in a mutation.,1
"A piece of an individual chromosome containing one or more genes can be deleted or moved to a different location on the chromosome, or even to a different chromosome.",1
Such rearrangements of the chromosome often have drastic effects on the expression of these genes.,1
"In 1991,a new kind of mutation was discovered that involves an increase in the number of copies of repeated codons, called tandem repeats.",1
The increase in repeated sequences seems to be involved in a number ofinherited disorders.,1
The first known example was fragileX syndrome—a syndrome that results in a number of mental and behavioral impairments.,1
"Near the end of a normal X chromosome, there is a section of CGG codons that repeat about 30 times.",1
Individuals with fragile X have CGG codons that repeat hundreds of times.,1
"The syndrome received its name because the repeated area on the tip of the X chromosomes appears as a fragile piece hanging off the X chromosome, as illustrated in Figure 12.21.",1
"Currently, the mechanism by which the repeats expand from generation to generation is not known.",1
Reading Check List and describe three types of mutations.,0
"Protein folding and stability You might expect that large changes in the DNA code, such as frameshift mutations or changes in position, lead to genetic disorders.",1
"However,small changes like substitutions also can lead to genetic disorders.",1
"The change of one amino acid for another can change the sequence ofamino acids in a protein enough to change both the folding and stability of the protein, as illustrated in Figure 12.22.",1
"In Chapter ll,you learned about a genetic disorder caused by a single point mutation called sickle-cell disease.",1
"In the case of sickle-cell disease, the codon for a glutamic acid(GAA)has been changed to a valine(GUA)in the protein.",1
This change in composition changes the structure of hemoglobin and is the cause of this disorder.,1
"Figure 12.21 Fragile X syndrome is due to many extra repeated CGG units near the end of the X chromosome, making the lower tip of the X chromosome appear fragile.",1
Figure 12.22 A single amino acid substitution can cause the genetic disorder sickle-cell disease.,1
What happens to the protein with the substituted amino acid?,0
"Mutagen comes from the Latin word mutare, meaning to change and from the Greek word genes, meaning born.",1
Hemoglobin is made of four polypeptide chains—two sets of two identical chains.,1
The molecule also contains a large carbon-ring structure that binds iron called the heme group.,1
"The substituted glutamic acid is located near the start of one set of chains, as shown in Figure 12.22.",1
"Glutamic acid is a polar amino acid, but the valine that substitutes for it in sickle-cell disease is nonpolar.",1
"Because of the charge difference, thesickle-cell hemoglobin folds differently than normal hemoglobin.",1
The abnormal folding of the protein caused by the mutation results in a change to the sickle shape of the red blood cell.,1
"Numerous other diseases involve problems with protein folding,including Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer.",1
"Some mutations,especially point mutations, can occur spontaneously.",1
"During replication, DNA polymerase sometimes adds the wrong nucleotides.",1
"Because the DNA polymerase has a proofreading function, the wrong nucleotide gets added only for one in one hundred thousand bases; it goes unfixed in less than one in one billion.",1
Certain chemicals and radiation also can damage DNA.Substances which cause mutations are called mutagens (MYEW tuh junz).,1
Many different chemicals have been cassified as mutagens.,1
Some of these chemicals affect DNA by changing the chemical structure of the bases.,1
"Often these changes cause bases to mispair, or bond, with the wrong base.",1
Other chemical mutagens have chemical structures that resemble nucleotides so closely that they can substitute for them.,1
"Once these imposter bases are incorporated into the DNA, it can not replicate properly.",1
"This type of chemical has become useful medically, especially in the treatment of HIV—the virus that causes AIDS.Many drugs used to treat HIV and other viral infections mimic various nucleotides.",1
"Once the drug is incorporated in the viral DNA, the DNA cannot copy itself properly.",1
How can we know if a compound is a mutagen?,0
The Ames test is used to identify mutagens.,1
The test uses a strain of bacteria that cannot make the amino acid histidine.,1
The bacteria are exposed to a suspected mutagen and grow on a medium without histidine.,1
The bacteria that grow have a mutation called a reversion because they reverted to the natural condition of making histidine.,1
The compounds in the graph were Ames tested.,0

"High-energy forms of radiation, such as X rays and gamma rays, are highly mutagenic.",1
"When the radiation reaches the DNA, electrons absorb the energy.",1
"The electrons can escape their atom, leaving behind a free radical.",1
"Free radicals are charged atoms with unpaired electrons that react violently with other molecules, including DNA.",1
Ultraviolet (UV)radiation from the Sun contains less energy than X-ray radiation and does not cause electrons to be ejected from the atoms.,1
"However, UV radiation can cause adjacent thymine bases to bind to each other, disrupting the structure of DNA, as shown in Figure 12.23.DNA with this structure disruption, or kink, are unable to replicate properly unless repaired.",1
"When a mutation in a body cell, also called a somatic cell, escapes the repair mechanism, it becomes part of the genetic sequence in that cell and in future daughter cells.",1
Somatic cell mutations are not passed on to the next generation.,1
"In some cases, the mutations do not cause problems for the cell.",1
"They could be sequences not used by the adult cell when the mutation occurred, the mutation might have occurred in an exon, or the mutation might not have changed the amino acid coded for.",1
These mutations are called neutral mutations.,1
"When the mutation results in the production of an abnormal protein, the cell might not be able to perform its normal function, and cell death might occur.",1
"In Chapter 9,you learned that mutations in body cells that cause the cell cycle to be unregulated can lead to cancer.",1
All of these effects are contained within the cells of the organism as long as only body cells are affected.,1
"When mutations occur in sex cells,also called germ-line cells, the mutations are passed on to the organism's offspring and will be present in every cell of the offspring.",1
"In many cases, these mutations do not affect the function of cells in the organism, though they might affect the offspring drastically.",1
"When the mutations result in an abnormal protein, the results often are more far reaching than when an abnormal protein is produced in an isolated body cell.",1

Coin collectors separate rare coins from all other coins because the rare ones are more valuable.,0
"Just as certain coins are selected for their value, certain plants and animals have been selected and bred to produce organisms with traits that are valuable to humans.",1
Selective Breeding,0
"You might be familiar with different breeds of dogs, such as Saint Bernards, huskies, and German shepherds.",1
Observe some of the phenotypic traits of each breed in Figure 13.1.,1
"All have strong, muscular bodies.",1
"In addition, Saint Bernards have traits such as a keen sense of smell that make them good rescue dogs.",1
Huskies are endurance runners and pull sleds long distances.,1
German shepherds are highly trainable for special services.,1
"Since ancient times, humans have bred animals with certain traits to obtain offspring that have desired traits.",1
"As a result, these traits become more common.",1
Breeding for certain desired traits is not restricted to animals alone.,1
"Plants also are bred to produce desired traits, such as larger fruits and shorter growing times.",1
The process by which desired traits of certain plants and animals are selected and passed on to their future generations is called selective breeding.,1
"Through the processes of hybridization and inbreeding, desired traits can be passed on to future generations.",1
Hybridization Recall from Chapter 10 that crossing parent organisms with different forms of a trait to produce offspring with specific traits results in hybrids.,1
"Farmers, animal breeders, scientists, and gardeners widely use the production of hybrids, also known as hybridization.",1
They select traits that will give hybrid organisms a competitive edge.,1
"These hybrid organisms can be bred to be more disease-resistant, to produce more offspring, or to grow faster.",1
"For example, plant breeders might choose to cross two different varieties of tomato plants in order to produce a hybrid that has both the disease resistance of one parent and the fast growth rate of the other parent.",1
Care must be taken to identify organisms with desired traits and successfully cross them to yield the right combination of traits from both parents.,1
A disadvantage of hybridization is that it is time consuming and expensive.,1
"For example, it took rice breeders three decades to produce hybrid rice varieties that can produce higher yields than nonhybrid varieties.",1
"Because hybrids can be bred to be more nutritious, to have the ability to adapt to a wide range of changes in the environment, and to produce greater numbers of offspring, the advantages of hybridization sometimes outweigh the disadvantages.",1
"Inbreeding Once a breeder observes a desired trait in an organism, a process is needed to ensure that the trait is passed on to future generations.",1
"This process, in which two closely related organisms are bred to have the desired traits and to eliminate the undesired ones in future generations, is called inbreeding.",1
Pure breeds are maintained by inbreeding.,1
"Clydesdale horses, Angus cattle, and German shepherd dogs are all examples of organisms produced by inbreeding.",1
You might have seen Clydesdale horses at parades and petting zoos.,1
Horse breeders first bred the Clydesdale horse in Scotland hundreds of years ago for use as a farm horse.,1
"Because of their strong build, agility, and obedient nature, Clydesdales originally were inbred and used extensively for pulling heavy loads.",1
A disadvantage of inbreeding is that harmful recessive traits also can be passed on to future generations.,1
Inbreeding increases the chance of homozygous recessive offspring.,1
"If both parents carry the recessive allele, the harmful trait likely will not be eliminated.",1
Reading Check Explain the difference between hybridization and inbreeding.,0

"4.Trade flowers with another lab group and, using the cotton swab, gently apply the pollen from your flower to the stigma of the pistil of the new flower.",0
Analysis,0
"1.Infer When breeders hybridize lilies, they transfer pollen to the stigma of an unopened lily flower and then cover the stigma with a foil cap.",0
Why do you think this would be necessary?,0
2. Think Critically,0
A breeder produces a hybrid lily which then is allowed to grow and produce seeds naturally .,0
"When these seeds are planted, the new lily plants do not have the same characterisitics as the would occur.",0
Figure 13.2 The genotype of a white grapefruit tree can be determined by the results of a test cross with a homozygous red grapefruit.,1
An important thing a breeder has to determine when producing a hybrid is the genotype of the hybrid.,1
"Once a breeder observes the desired trait, if the trait is dominant, then the genotype of the organism could be homozygous dominant or heterozygous.",1
The exact genotype is determined by performing a test cross.,1
A test cross involves breeding an organism that has the unknown genotype with one that is homozygous recessive for the desired trait.,1
"If the parent's genotype is homozygous dominant, all of the offspring will have the dominant phenotype; if it is heterozygous, the offspring will show a l:l phenotypic ratio.",1
Performing a test cross Suppose a breeder wants to produce hybrid white grapefruits.,1
"In grapefruit trees, white color is the dominant trait while red is recessive.",1
"Therefore, the red grapefruit trees in the orchard must be homozygous recessive(ww).",1
The genotype of the hybrid white grapefruit tree obtained by the breeder can be homozygous dominant (WW) or heterozygous(Ww) for the white color.,1
"Therefore, the breeder has to perform a test cross to determine the genotype of the white grapefruit tree.",1
"Recall from Chapter 10 that when performing a cross, pollen from the flower of one plant is transferred to the female organ in a flower of another plant.",1
"Results As shown in the top Punnett square in Figure 13.2, if the white grapefruit tree is homozygous dominant(WW)and is crossed with a red grapefruit tree(ww), then all of the offspring will be heterozygous (Ww)and white in color.",1
"In this case, all of the offspring will have the dominant phenotype.",1
"However, as shown in the second Punnett square in Figure 13.2, if the white grapefruit tree is heterozygous(Ww), then half the number of offspring will be white and half will be red, and the phenotypic ratio will be 1:1.Review the results in the Punnett squares in Figure 13.2.",1
"If the white grapefruit tree is homozygous, all offspring will be heterozygous—white in color.",1

"GFP,which is a substance naturally found in jellyfishes that live in the north Pacific Ocean, emits a green light when it is exposed to ultraviolet light.",1
"Organisms that have been genetically engineered to synthesize the DNA for GFP, such as the mosquito larvae shown in Figure 13.3, can be easily identified in the presence of ultraviolet light.",1
The GFPDNA is attached to exogenous DNA to verify that the DNA has been inserted into the organism.,1

You have learned that selective breeding is used to produce plants and animals with desired traits.,1
Genetic engineering can be used to increase or decrease the expression of specific genes in selected organisms.,1
It has many applications from human health to agriculture.,1

"A restriction enzyme, also called an endonuclease(en doh NEW klee ayz), cuts the viral DNA into fragments after it enters the bacteria.",1
"Since their discovery in the late 1960s, scientists have identified and isolated hundreds of restriction enzymes.",1
They use restriction enzymes as powerful tools for isolating specific genes or regions of the genome.,1
"When the restriction enzyme cleaves genomic DNA, it creates fragments of different sizes that are unique to every individual.",1
"EcoRI One restriction enzyme that is used widely by scientists is known as EcoRI.As illustrated in Figure 13.4, EcoRI specifically cuts DNA containing the sequence GAATTC.",1
The ends of the DNA fragments created by EcoRI are called sticky ends because they contain single-stranded DNA that is complementary.,1
"The ability of some restriction enzymes to create fragments with sticky ends is important, because these sticky ends can be joined together with other DNA fragments that have complementary sticky ends.",1
"Fragment pattern A staining solution binds to the separated DNA fragments in the gel, making them visible under ultraviolet light.",1
"However, not all restriction enzymes create sticky ends.",1
Some enzymes produce fragments containing blunt ends—created when the restriction enzyme cuts straight across both strands.,1
Blunt ends do not have regions of single-stranded DNA and can join to any other DNA fragment with blunt ends.,1
Connection o PhysicsGel electrophoresis An electric current is used to separate the DNA fragments according to the size of the fragments in a process called gel electrophoresis.,1
Figure 13.5 shows how the DNA fragments are loaded on the negatively charged end of a gel.,1
"When an electric current is applied, the DNA fragments move toward the positive end of the gel.",1
The smaller fragments move farther faster than the larger ones.,1
The unique pattern created based on the size of the DNA fragment can be compared to known DNA fragments for identification.,1

Recombinant DNA Technology,0
"When DNA fragments have been separated by gel electrophoresis, fragments of a specific size can be removed from the gel and combined with DNA fragments from another source.",1
This newly generated DNA molecule with DNA from different sources is calledirecombinant DNA.,1
"Recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized the way scientists study DNA, because it enables individual genes to be studied.",1
Large quantities of recombinant DNA molecules are needed in and viruses are commonly used vectors.,1
"Plasmids—small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that occur naturally in bacteria and yeast cells—can be used as vectors because they can be cut with restriction enzymes.",1
"If a plasmid and a DNA fragment obtained from another genome have been cleaved by the same restriction enzyme, the ends of each DNA fragment will be complementary and can be combined, as shown in Figure 13.6.",1
"A n enzyme normally used by cells in DNA repair and replication, called DNA ligase, joins the two DNA fragments chemically.",1
Ligase joins DNA fragments that have sticky ends as well as those that have blunt ends.,1
Examine Figure 13.6 again.,0
Notice that the resulting circular DNA molecule contains the plasmid DNA and the DNA fragment isolated from another genome.,1
This recombinant plasmid DNA molecule now can be inserted into a host cell so that large quantities of this type of recombinant DNA can be made.,1

"Gene cloning To make a large quantity of recombinant plasmid DNA, bacterial cells are mixed with recombinant plasmid DNA.",1
"Some of the bacterial cells take up the recombinant plasmid DNA through a process called transformation, as shown in Figure 13.7.",1
Bacterial cells can be transformed using electric pulsation or heat.,1
"Recall that all cells, including bacterial cells, have plasma membranes.",1
A short electric pulse or a brief rise in temperature temporarily creates openings in the plasma membrane of the bacteria.,1
"These temporary openings allow small molecul es, such as the recombinant plasmid DNA, to enter the bacterial cell.",1
The bacterial cells make copies of the recombinant plasmid DNA during cell replication.,1
"Large numbers of identical bacteria, each containing the inserted DNA molecules, can be produced through this process called cloning.",1
Recombinant plasmid DNA contains a gene that codes for resistance to an antibiotic such as ampicillin (AMP).,1
Researchers use this gene to distinguish between bacterial cells that have taken up the recombinant plasmid DNA and those that have not.,1
"Notice in Figure 13.7 that when the transformed bacterial cells are exposed to the specific antibiotic, only the bacterial cells that have the plasmid survive.",1
DNA sequencing The sequence of the DNA nucleotides of most organisms is unknown.,1
Knowing the sequence of an organism's DNA or of a cloned DNA fragment provides scientists with valuable information for further study.,1
"The sequence of a gene can be used to predict the function of the gene, to compare genes with similar sequences from other organisms, and to identify mutations or errors in the DNA sequence.",1
"Because the genomes of most organisms are made up of millions of nucleotides, the DNA molecules used for sequencing reactions first must be cut into smaller fragments using restriction enzymes.",1

Follow Figure 13.8 to understand how DNA is sequenced.,0
"Scientists mix an unknown DNA fragment, DNA polymerase, and the four nucleotides—A,C,G,Tin a tube.",1
"A small amount of each nucleotide is tagged with a different color of fluorescent dye, which also modifies the structure of the nucleotide.",1
"Every time a modified fluorescent-tagged nucleotide is incorporated into the newly synthesized strand, the reaction stops.",1
This produces DNA strands of different lengths.,1
The sequencing reaction is complete when the tagged DNA fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis.,1
The gel is then analyzed in an automated DNA sequencing machine that detects the color of each tagged nucleotide.,1
The sequence of the original DNA template is determined from the order of the tagged fragments.,1
"Polymerase chain reaction Once the sequence ofa DNAfragment is known, a technique called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to make millions of copies of a specific region of a DNA fragment.",1
PCR is extremely sensitive and can detect a single DNA molecule in a sample.,1
"PCR is useful because this single DNA molecule then can be copied, or amplified, numerous times to be used for DNA analysis.",1
Follow Figure 13.9 as you read about the steps of PCR.,0
"Step 1 PCR is performed by placing the DNA fragment to be copied, DNA polymerase, the four DNA nucleotides, and two short singlestranded pieces of DNA called primers in a tube.",1
The primers are complementary to the ends of the DNA fragment that will be copied and used as starting points for DNA synthesis.,1
PCR begins when the tube is heated.,1
Step 2 The heat separates the two strands of the template DNA fragment.,1
"When the tube is cooled, the primers can bind to each strand of the template DNA.An automated machine called a thermocycler is used to cycle the tube containing all of the components involved in PCR through various hot and cool temperatures.",1
"Step 3 As shown in Figure 13.9, each primer is made to bind to one strand of the DNA fragment.",1
"Once the primers are bound, DNA polymerase incorporates the correct nucleotides between the two primers as in DNA replication.",1
"This process of heating, cooling, and nucleotide incorporation is repeated 20 to 40 times, resulting in millions of copies of the original fragment.",1
"Because the separation of DNA strands requires heat, the DNA polymerase used in PCR has to be able to withstand high temperatures.",1
"This special DNA polymerase was isolated from a thermophilic, or heat-loving, bacterium such as those found living in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park.",1
"Because PCR can detect a single DNA molecule in a sample, it has become one of the most powerful tools used by scientists.",1
"PCR is not used only by researchers in laboratories, but also by forensic scientists to identify suspects and victims in crime investigations, and by doctors to detect infectious diseases, such as AIDS. polymerase analogy.",1
Figure 13.9 PCR is a biological version of a copy machine.,1
"During each PCR cydle, the reaction mixture is heated to separate the DNA strands and then cooled to allow primers to bind to complementary sequences.",1
The DNA polymerase then adds nudeotides to form new DNA molecules.,1

Biotechnology—the use of genetic engineering to find solutions to problems—makes it possible to produce organisms that contain individual genes from another organism.,1
Recall that organisms such as the mosquito larvae shown in Figure 13.3 have a gene from another organism.,1
"Such organisms, genetically engineered by inserting a gene from another organism, are called transgenic organisms.",1
"Transgenic animals, plants, and bacteria are used not only for research, but also for medical and agricultural purposes.",1
"Transgenic animals Currently, scientists produce most transgenic animals in laboratories for biological research.",1
"Mice, fruit flies,and the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, also called C.elegans, are widely used in research laboratories around the world to study diseases and develop ways to treat them.",1

Other crops are being grown commercially and being field-tested.,1
"These crops include sweet-potato plants that are resistant to a virus that could kill most of the African harvest, rice plants with increased iron and vitamins that could decrease malnutrition in Asian countries, and a variety of plants able to survive extreme weather conditions.",1
"Prospective crops include bananas that produce vaccines for infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B, and plants that produce biodegradable plastics.",1
"Transgenic bacteria Insulin, growth hormones, and substances that dissolve blood clots are made by transgenicbacteria.",1
"Transgenic bacteria also slow the formation of ice crystals on crops to protect them from frost damage, clean up oil spills more efficiently, and decompose garbage.",1

These technologies help to interpret the function of newly identified human genes.,1
"Figure 13.11 lf all the DNA in the human genome were fused together in one continuous line, it would stretch from California to Panama.",1
Sequencing the genome Recall from Chapter 10 that human DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes.,1
"In order to determine one continuous human genome sequence, each of the 46 human chromosomes was cleaved.",1
Several different restriction enzymes were used in order to produce fragments with overlapping sequences.,1
"These fragments were combined with vectors to create recombinant DNA, cloned to make many copies, and sequenced using automated sequencing machines.",1
Computers analyzed the overlapping regions to generate one continuous sequence.,1
Decoding the sequence of the human genome can be compared to reading a book that was printed in code.,1

"In order to understand what is written, you have to decode the jumbled text.",1
"Similarly, scientists had to decode the genetic code in the human genome.",1
"After sequencing the entire human genome, scientists observed that less than two percent of all of the nucleotides in the human genome code for all the proteins in the body.",1
"That is, the genome is filled with long stretches of repeated sequences that have no direct function.",1
These regions are called noncoding sequences.,1
"DNA fingerprinting Unlike the protein-coding regions of DNA that are almost identical among individuals, the long stretches of noncoding regions of DNA are unique to each individual.",1
"When these regions are cut by restriction enzymes, as described earlier in this chapter, the set of DNA fragments produced is unique to every individual.",1
DNA fingerprinting involves separating these DNA fragments using gel electrophoresis in order to observe the distinct banding patterns that are unique to every individual.,1
